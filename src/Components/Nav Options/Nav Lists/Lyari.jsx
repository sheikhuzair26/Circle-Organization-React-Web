              Circleâ€™s Tech Karo initiative in Lyari aims to provide Digital

              The aim is to bridge the digital gender and economic divide and
              leverage the power of technology for economic transformation of
              families and communities. Locals say that there are more than 70
              community centers within Lyari, however not a single one opens
              doors for women. By setting up a digital literacy class not only
              CIRCLE aims to make them freelancers so that they can become
              financially stable but also create a safe space where women are
              welcomed, can learn skills and grow.
