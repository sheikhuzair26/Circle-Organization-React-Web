          Circleâ€™s Tech Karo initiative in Lyari aims to provide Digital
          Marketing Skills to young women from underserved communities to help
          them become freelancers.

          The aim is to bridge the digital gender and economic divide and
          leverage the power of technology for economic transformation of
          families and communities. Locals say that there are more than 70
          community centers within Lyari, however not a single one opens doors
          for women. By setting up a digital literacy class not only CIRCLE aims
          to make them freelancers so that they can become financially stable
          but also create a safe space where women are welcomed, can learn
          skills and grow.
